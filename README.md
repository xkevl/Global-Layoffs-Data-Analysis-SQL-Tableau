# Global Layoffs Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes global layoff data using SQL to uncover trends across companies, industries, and time. The workflow includes data cleaning, transformation, exploratory data analysis (EDA) to generate actionable business insights, and creating an interactive tableau dashboard to visualize layoff trends and company performance.

## Data Cleaning Steps Performed

The following transformations were applied:
- Removed duplicate records
- Handled missing values (NULLS) appropriately
- Standardized text formatting
- Converted data types where necessary

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Key Questions Answered:

- What industries experienced the most layoffs?
- Which companies raised the most funding?
- How did layoffs trend over time?
- Which companies had the highest layoffs per year?
- Which companies maximized funding while minimizing layoffs?

## Tableau Dashboard

Key Features: 
- KPI cards showing total layoffs and total companies
- Time-series analysis of layoff trends
- Industry and company breakdowns
- Scatter plot analyzing funding vs layoffs efficiency

## Key SQL Concepts Used

- `JOIN` for data validation
- `SUM` and `MAX` for aggregations
- `ROW_NUMBER`, `RANK`, and `DENSE_RANK` for window functions
- `DATE-FORMAT` for time-based analysis
- CTEs

## Results

After cleaning:
- Removed 5 duplicate records
- Standardized 14 inconsistent fields
- Converted the date column for 2,536 rows
- Improved dataset quality for analysis and visualization

After EDA:
- The consumer and retail industry had the most layoffs from 2020-03-11 to 2023-03-06 with 45182 and 43613 layoffs respectively.
- In 2020 Uber, Booking.com, Groupon, and Airbnb were part of the top 5 companies with the most layoffs. COVID made it so transportation, travel, and going outside in general were kept to a minimum.
- In 2023 the technology sector took a massive hit in layoffs with companies like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon being part of the top 5.
- TikTok India, Grover, and N26 were the top 3 companies that raised the msot funding while reporting lower layoffs.

After dashboard creation:
- Layoffs peaked during specific time periods, indicating macroeconomic shifts
- The tech industry accounted for majority of the layoffs
- Certain companies generated high gross income while maintaining relatively low layoffs
